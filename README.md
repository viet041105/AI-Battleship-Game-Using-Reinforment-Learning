Battleship AI: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach
This repository contains an advanced AI agent designed to master the classic game of Battleship. The agent is built upon a Deep Q-Network (DQN), a cornerstone of modern Deep Reinforcement Learning. It learns optimal strategies entirely through self-play, leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to interpret the game board spatially.

The project demonstrates key competencies in Reinforcement Learning, Neural Network design, and strategic AI development.
